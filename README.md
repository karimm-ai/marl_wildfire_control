# marl_wildfire_control
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Cooperative Control in Wildfires

Project Details:
  - Created a complex highly stochastic 2D wildfire environment from scratch.
  - Simualated learning of homogenous and hetoregenous agents with centralized critic Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) Algorithm.
  - Added an attention mechanism to MADDPG to compare between results.
  - Evaluation metrics:
    1. Total number of trees suppressed.
    2. Total number of trees suppressed by both classes of agents in heterogenous scenarios.
    3. Total rewards accumulated.
